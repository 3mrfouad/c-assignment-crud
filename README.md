#CITATION SUMMARY: 

(1) I didn't copy any code blocks while working on this assignment, however, I was researching how to do certain statements, and almost 99% of the time studied from Microsoft documentation, I have kept list of all links that I have used during this assignment within the Repo, file name: Resources.txt
(2) For fun I have taken an example from Microsoft documentation that plays music, I didn't understand the code well, and didn't spend time to understand it as it is not core to the project, and I have added it just for fun.

Program added features:
Besides the Rubric requirements and challanges, I have added the following features to the program as I was to make it functional program.
(1) User input validation wherever the user input is required that included menu options selection, data entry, file names entry, etc.
(2) I have design the program to be menu based except for when the user is in "new record" entry loop, I used "exit" as instructed in the Rubric. Menu based consoles are better interface with the user and leaves less room for errors.
(3) For the menu options selections I have used the console.readkey(true) method in order to capture the user input from the first key pressed, to minimize validation and enhance user experience.
(4) For the edit, delete, import and export features I have displayed what is in the database to better help the user in visual manner.
(5) The list sorting was done whenever the database is edited, deleted, displayed, newly entered per the challanges, I have done sorting while exporting to file too.
(5) For entertainment I have changed the console color to darkblue/white ... cosmatics but I felt it is better than the regular black/white console.
